        <h2>Project Summary</h2>
        <p>The project is a collection of tea places I frequent, utilizing the knowledge I've accumulated in HTMl/CSS/JavaScript.</p>

        <h2>Comparison Project 1</h2>
        <p><a href="http://humankindmgmt.com/about">This</a> website focuses on talent representation by embracing fashion ideas and photography. The core values include diversity, purpose, inclusiveness, and authenticity. The Montreal-based program aims at going beyond physical appearances to help people nurture self-confidence. It focuses on empowering people from diverse backgrounds to embrace their strengths and pursue life dreams. The interface design allows artists, models and other members of the public to view the existing photographs by clicking on each for more details. The options occur at the top of the page. Moreover, users can learn more about the gallery by clicking the “meet humankind” tab. They can also join the organization by clicking on the “join” tab. Each of the images comprises descriptions of the subjects, their career journey, and progress. The website requires improvements in the visibility of navigation tabs.</p>

        <h2>Comparison Project 2</h2>
        <p><a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/search/human+empowerment">This</a> website empowers people to develop images, videos, and other designs. Users also gain an overview of guidelines regarding how to edit their work. I think that the website is helpful to numerous people who wish to learn more about their areas of interest and experience meaningful growth. The multiple tabs at the top of the site help people to directly click on the desired areas and begin learning. Moreover, it is possible to click on different images and obtain information concerning the period of production, purpose, and description of subjects. The user interface is more complicated than that of ‘Humankind’.  It not only comprises numerous navigation options but also suggestions on different types of images. The user interface design would be easier to use if the site developers categorized the tabs in fewer sections. </p>

        <h2>Project Goals</h2>
        <p>The project focuses on the development of a photo gallery that can help me record my life. The images will comprise detailed descriptions of the subjects and important words related to my life.</p>

        <h2>Design Strategies</h2>
        <p>The gallery will comprise captivating features such as high-quality images, simple language, minimal navigation tabs, and appealing themes.  The gallery will mainly offer information in the English language. The images will be organized in an irregular layout. Consequently, users will be in a position to have fun with the website. A pink and white theme will be appropriate for the site since it offers an attractive impact.</p>

        <h2>Interaction Strategies</h2>
        <p>The gallery will allow users to interact in the view sections. They can access the site at any time. </p>

        <h2>Experience Goals</h2>
        <p>The project goals include empowering people to discover,  connect the love of life with people from different backgrounds by offering a virtual platform for viewing life images. I plan to achieve the goals by collect high-quality images in my life.</p>
