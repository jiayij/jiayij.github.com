			<h2>Journal 1 - Best practices for form design</h2>

			<p>Developers have to be careful with the way they release innovations thanks to UX design. UX design has to be logical enough to make various users' actions easier to finish with a couple of clicks. The material helps to learn how to support efficient usage thanks to proper design and personal experience.</p>

            <p>First of all, the article helps to assume the at comfort means efficient usage. Vertical forms in a single row are as significant as the compact lust of questions. Excessive questions make it tiresome for users to fill the form (Ansari par. 2). A layout with more than one column has the same effect. It means that UX designers have to prioritize psychological comfort over aesthetic one. Designing features interestingly can lead to the fall of productivity of the website or application.</p>
            
            <p>Secondly, these findings are possible to confirm thanks to personal experience. I used to believe that users and employers seek novel designs as long as they associate them with advanced skills and product quality. However, they indeed ignore it when it comes to complications that they do not recognize. Leaving the form unfilled because there are too many questions or rows can happen unconsciously. It is the developers' task to avoid provoking users to refuse the website's suggestions or applications.</p>

            <p>In conclusion, UX design has to support efficient usage, which can be proven with personal experience. Once a person tries remembering a lack of interest in some website, it will be easy to remember examples of the uncomfortable design. UX design has to provide products for productive work, which makes it easier for users to complete intellectual tasks.</p>
