			<p>The MABA website has one of the most innovative uses of visual style.</p>

            <p>First, the homepage looks like a slideshow, with shifting images that may appear to be a mere gallery. However, upon clicking on any of the images, more details emerge that was unexpected from the initial view. The detailed images hint at the website’s offerings and associated brands. Secondly, navigation on the website is in itself propelled by the visual style. Clicking on the top left corner leads to a drop-down list of different sectors and expertise that are offered by the organization in question. The transition to one of the sectors/expertise will be followed by a dark background, but once the destination page opens one is welcomed by highly pompous images again. The shift from black to color is a beautiful infusion of functionality within the website's interactive and navigation features.</p>
            
            <p>When the background is black and plain, the website is telling the visitor that they are yet to arrive at their preferred destination. Once one reaches the page they desired to open, the arrival is announced by the excess color and beautiful shapes. Again, the design of the website’s icons is exceptional. The cursor, while in use on the website, takes a special round shape which is filled with red color whenever one point at an active link. The change in cursor design makes the viewer have an entirely different experience than they would have on any other website. To crown it all, the team behind the website is represented by a picture where their design flair is evident. The style in the group photo speaks to the abilities and talents of the team behind the website, departing from the traditionally lengthy bio descriptions. Overall, the use of visual style communicates the purpose of the website, helps in navigation and interaction with users, and distinguishes the user experience from other websites they visit.</p>
