			<p><a href="https://fleximize.com/articles/006450/famous-photos.">Selected for this discussion are the photos featured on the website</a></p>

			<p>The author describes the photos as having changed the world. There are a number of key elements to the photos.</p>

            <p>First, as the title suggests, the photos all represent landmark events in the history of mankind. From the moon landing to the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the photos are symbols of events that forever changed the course of history. They are an embodiment of a photo being worth a thousand words, as it is commonly said. Secondly, the photos are heavily laden with emotion that instantly strikes the viewer. The battle of Aleppo is a paradigm example, with the instant view of the distressed child immediately showing that something had shaken the consciousness of humanity. The “Tank man” is yet another example of where one emotionally connects with the scene upon seeing the single man standing before military tanks. In sum, the photos all have serious symbolism that draws the audience’s emotions.</p>
            
            <p>Elsewhere, the photos demand careful visual thinking strategies for one to discern the big picture of what is really going on. A good example is the “sunset on Mars” image, which may not make much sense on the surface. All one sees is a beautiful sunset image but it is unclear why such an image would be important or considered to have changed the world. However, upon a closer examination, one would observe that the image was taken on the red planet. It is also clear that the space represented is uninhabited and has no form of visible life, even plant life. This may point the viewer into the right speculation that the picture was taken outside our planet. On the whole, it is clear that the images featured on the website are special.</p>
