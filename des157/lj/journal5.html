			<h2>Journal 5 - Game Design UX Best Practices</h2>
			<time datetime="2021-02-23">Feb 23rd, 2021</time>
			<p><a href="https://uxplanet.org/game-design-ux-best-practices-guide-4a3078c32099">Game Design UX Best Practices by Amir Dori</a></p>

			<p>In my opinion, the article by Dori provides an informative and helpful insight into best UX practices for designing games and apps for various platforms. His explanations regarding the use of UI positions are a perfect example. Dori uses simple illustrations to show how various sections of the screen of a smartphone or tablet can be easy or difficult to reach, depending on their proximity to the user’s fingers. In such a way, Dori skillfully makes cases for the placement of buttons, menus, ads, and other interactive elements in easily accessible areas of the screen. This lesson also gives insight into the more rational placement of sliders, pop-ups, and other elements. Such simple and obvious examples successfully affirm the author’s credentials, suggesting that his recommendations indeed stem from best practices, not subjective opinions.</p>
            
            <p>While I generally agree with the author’s general message, I find some of his arguments partially problematic. For instance, Dori advises app developers to avoid using an “X” button in pop-ups because many users might interpret it as a sign of annoying content and try to tap it instantly.  However, this recommendation overlooks the fact that many people also associate an “X” button with the quick closing of an app or tab. This feature is visible on both PC and touchscreen devices. Hence, by removing this button, developers might deprive users of a familiar feature. My biggest concern is that such a step might make users feel that developers force them to read a specific message. I suspect most people would not want to have such an experience. For that reason, I think mobile game developers should utilize this advice sparingly, especially if the pop-up contains long text or lacks “OK,” “Done,” or other commonly recognizable buttons.</p>
