			<h2>Journal 2 - How to Avoid Misusing Lightboxes</h2>
			<time datetime="2021-01-28">Jan 28th, 2021</time>
			<p><a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/overuse-of-overlays/">Overuse of Overlays: How to Avoid Misusing Lightboxes</a></p>
			<p>In the article “Overuse of Overlays: How to Avoid Misusing Lightboxes,” Whitenton discusses the undesirable impacts of poorly implemented overlays and lightboxes. They frustrate page users and delay task completion. The author describes various ways in which designers can minimize the practices of overusing overlays. For instance, they can determine the target audience and whether it will be a major interruption if it occurs at a given time. If the lightbox is vital, the designers need to offer visible close commands to allow users to return to the main page. I can greatly relate to the discussion as overused light boxes often cause unexpected disruptions and confusion, especially when dealing with unfamiliar pages.</p>

            <p>I think web page designers need to understand the experiences of users whenever they encounter multiple overlays. In most cases, the user spends some time trying to identify the close option. The lack of a clear close button appears to be an intentional action by the designers, such that the user can obtain the contents before closing. Some of the major impacts of overlay usage include disorientation, content blockage, and time-consumption. Although it is an aggressive way of reaching the target audience, they are likely to perceive the information negatively. I find it crucial for them to follow Whitenton’s guidelines concerning the proper use of overlays and key considerations before choosing to include it on a certain page.</p>
            
            <p>I agree with the author’s idea of performing thorough planning processes before a designer can choose to place overlays on different pages. They should ensure that the information is vital for the users and place it at a point and period that does not cause any disruptions. In other cases, they can choose an alternative way of relaying messages to the reader without blocking the main page.</p>
