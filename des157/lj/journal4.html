                    This image is interesting for at least two reasons. Firstly, it creatively combines a selfie-and an ordinary picture, since the reflection of the person taking the photo combines with a reflection of the street. Secondly, it includes paper notes attached to the glass that contain motivational messages and appeal to float. The image relates to the topic - "Accept yourself" because the paper notes promote self-acceptance. One note tells the viewer that they are beautiful and, thus, have no reasons to hate themselves or be unhappy. On other notes, anonymous authors encourage people to love themselves or confess love for whoever is reading the message at the moment. My collection tells a story by combining visual and textual elements. It uses a reflection of a person as a reference to one’s reflection that all people need to embrace. Textual elements reinforce the central message

                    This image is a photo taken outdoors during either dawn or dusk when it is still too dark to accurately distinguish all shapes and colors. The twilight is definitely the central theme of this image. The sun appears to be rising or setting over a vast body of water, which might be sea or ocean. The twilight is one of the most exciting elements of this photo. It illuminates the horizon and produces the most diverse and stunning hues. It is also the only source of light across the whole picture. Another noteworthy detail is a frame visible on three out of four sides of the photo. It blocks the edges of the camera’s view. The most obvious aspect is twilight that gives this image some degree of clarity and helps to understand where the creator might have taken this mostly secretive photo. The most mysterious detail is the frame. It’s not clear whether it represents a window, decorative window bars, or something else.
